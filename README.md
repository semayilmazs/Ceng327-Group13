# Ceng327-Group13

This project demonstrates different thresholding techniques for image segmentation using Python and OpenCV.

1. **Global Thresholding**  
   Applies a fixed threshold value to segment the image.

2. **Otsu's Thresholding**  
   Automatically determines the optimal threshold by minimizing intra-class variance.

3. **Adaptive Thresholding**  
   Computes thresholds locally for different regions of the image, suitable for varying lighting conditions.
