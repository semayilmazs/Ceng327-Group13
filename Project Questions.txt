What is the main purpose of thresholding in image process?  

A-) Reduce the size of an image 
B-) Enhance image colors 
C-) To segment an image into different regions based on pixel intensity True 
D-) To blur an image for noise reduction 

Which thresholding method would likely perform better on images with complex lighting variations? 

A-) Global thresholding 
B-) Otsu's thresholding 
C-) Adaptive thresholding     True
D-)  Clustering thresholding

What is the main difference between Clustering Thresholding (using KMeans) and Otsu's Thresholding? 

A-) Otsu's Thresholding works on grayscale images, while Clustering Thresholding only works on colored images.
B-) Clustering Thresholding requires the user to specify the number of clusters, whereas Otsu's Thresholding automatically determines the optimal threshold for binary segmentation. True
C-) Otsu's Thresholding works by grouping pixels into multiple clusters, while Clustering Thresholding calculates a single global threshold.
D-) There is no difference. 

Which of the following threshold method that calculates the optimal threshold value by maximizing between class variation?
A-) Global thresholding 
B-) Otsu's thresholding True
C-) Adaptive thresholding   
D-)  Clustering thresholding

A-) Tumor detection in MRI scans
B-) Environmental monitoring through satellite imagery analysis
C-) Object detection in autonomous vehicles
D-) All of the above
